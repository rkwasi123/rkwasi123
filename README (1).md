Interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze ER visit data, track key metrics like patient demographics, wait times, satisfaction scores, and referral patterns.
I used Tableau Desktop to build this interactive Emergency Visits Dashboard below is the step I used:


Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize emergency room visit data for a healthcare provider, using demographic and operational insights.

Utilized data visualization tools to track key metrics, such as patient demographics (age, race, gender), ER wait times, and satisfaction ratings (average 4.99/10).

Designed a heatmap for identifying peak visit times and patterns by hour and day of the week, enabling staff to optimize resource allocation.

Created actionable insights on department referrals (e.g., General Practice, Orthopedics) to help guide improvements in patient care and reduce wait times (average wait: 35.26 minutes).

Enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on resource management and patient satisfaction improvement strategies.
