## 💼 What I Do

I build dashboards, reports, and analytics tools using Power BI, SQL, Tableau, and Excel.  
I focus on identifying trends, forecasting performance, and simplifying data for non-technical stakeholders.  
My work helps organizations improve efficiency, optimize operations, and understand their users.

## 🧠 My Approach

I believe in bridging the gap between data and decisions.  
My approach is:
- Insight-first: Focus on what the data reveals and how it can improve outcomes.
